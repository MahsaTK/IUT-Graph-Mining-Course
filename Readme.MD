# Graph Mining – Course Repository (4041)

Welcome to the **Graph Mining (4041)** course repository.  
This repo serves as a **central hub** for all course materials, datasets, project ideas, and practical sessions related to graph analysis and network science.

## Course Overview

This course explores how graphs (networks) model complex systems — from social connections and citation networks to biological pathways and infrastructure systems.  
Students will learn how to analyze, model, and mine graph-structured data using concepts from mathematics, computer science, and data mining.

**Instructor:** Dr.Zeinab Maleki     
**Institution:** Isfahan University of Technology  
**Level:** Undergraduate  
**Semester:** [Fall 2025]

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Understand and compute key **graph metrics** (degree distribution, clustering, path length, etc.)
- Compare **random graph models** (Erdős–Rényi, Watts–Strogatz, Barabási–Albert, Kleinberg)
- Perform **graph mining tasks** such as community detection and link prediction
- Use real-world **graph datasets** for analysis and project development
- Critically interpret structural differences between network types
- Perform **Clustering** tasks on differnet types of graphs
